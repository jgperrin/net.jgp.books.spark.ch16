# Spark in Action, 2nd edition - chapter 16

Welcome to Spark in Action, 2e, chapter 16. This chapter is about **checkpointing and caching**.

This code is designed to work with Apache Spark v3.0.1.

## Datasets

Original datasets can be downloaded from:
* [Goodreads books](https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks) by Soumik and coming from Kaggle.
* [Brazilian Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/crisparada/brazilian-cities) by Christina Parada and coming from Kaggle. 
  
## Labs

Each chapter has one or more labs. Labs are examples used for teaching in the book(https://www.manning.com/books/spark-in-action-second-edition?a_aid=jgp). You are encouraged to take ownership of the code and modify it, experiment with it, hence the use of the term **lab**.
